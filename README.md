# AutoPilotOps 

AutoPilotOps is an intelligent backend monitoring and analysis platform designed to proactively monitor APIs, evaluate system health, and provide actionable insights with minimal human intervention.

## Problem Statement

In modern backend systems, service failures and performance degradation often go unnoticed until users report issues. This reactive approach leads to downtime, poor user experience, and delayed recovery.

AutoPilotOps addresses this problem by continuously monitoring APIs, analyzing their behavior in real time, and classifying system health automatically.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Real-time API health monitoring  
- Response-time and availability analysis  
- Rule-based system health classification  
- Clean separation of monitoring and analysis logic  
- End-to-end backend service integration  
- Production-style FastAPI architecture

##  How AutoPilotOps Works

1. A user provides an API endpoint for monitoring  
2. The *Monitor Service* checks availability and response time  
3. The *Analyzer Service* applies decision rules  
4. A unified API response returns health status and severity
